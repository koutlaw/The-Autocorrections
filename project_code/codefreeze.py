print "Hey tiles Paul, I'm calling in response to the 88. You know that you said, and hey man, it's a conversation. And you know. I'll send you some links. I don't know how. Hopefully I'll be. But depending on what your objectives are. And you know it may be more useful to like I said talk and figure out. I think what your next steps would be. I'm gonna be around most of the day. I'm actually on T T O from tomorrow on through next week, so if you wanna call me today, that'd be good to do it. Take care.\n"
